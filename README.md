## How to Import the Database to my local machine ? 

#### Prerequisites:
a) MYSQL community ver 8.x for respected OS. <br>
b) MYSQL Drivers <br>
c) Preferebly Datagrip <br>

1- Start your MYSQL server on your local machine. <br>
2- Create a database named 'crypto'. <br>
3- Using 'crypto', choose 'Run SQL Script' and browse your machine for 'initial-dayche.sql' <br>
-- (Don't use Import/Export but instead you should use 'Run SQL Script' for it to work) <br>
4- Wait for the tables to be created and the data to be inserted. <br>
5- For your convenience, absolute path insertion is deleted and now it works automatically. So, no need for any absolute paths now. <br>
6- Also, considering step 4, 'initial-dayche.sql' has become a faily large file . but, it's ok . It will get the job done. <br>
7- Hopefully it's done! :D <br>
